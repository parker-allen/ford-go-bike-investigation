# Ford GoBike Data Exploration

## Dataset
I chose the Ford GoBike data that Udacity provided a link to. This dataset consists of information containing a lot of information about every bike that was checked out and brought back. This includes information about the member (age, gender), as well as duration and location that it was checked out from and brought back to.

## Summary of Findings
I included in my findings most of the finding that I found while conducting my exploration of the data. This included a breakdown of the age and gender of all of the users. Hourly,  day-of-the-week, daily, and monthly usage of the bikes, with the monthly data also broken down by age ranges that I defined. I also included findings based on customers that used the bikes vs subscribers that pay a flat fee for using the bikes, the difference in duration and broken down by month for each of the groups as well as age ranges for the monthly use. 

## Key Insights for Presentation

One of the biggest things that I discovered while doing this exploration was the
 difference between customers and subscribers. Customers ride bikes mostly for p
leasure while subscribers use it mostly for work. A majority of the riders are s
ubscribers and the main use that people get out of these bikes is for going to a
nd from work every day. This means that the rides drop drsdtically during the we
ekends.

The few resources outside of Udacity that I used are listed at the end of my findings notebook, but I will also list them here.
